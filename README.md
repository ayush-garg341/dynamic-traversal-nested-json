# dynamic-traversal-nested-json
Traversing nested json recursively

#### This is to show, how we can recursively traverse nested json to any depth of level and constructing similar json from it.
#### The json in random.json file is taken from `https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/laravel/get-a-random-array-from-a-nested-json` just for demo purpose.
